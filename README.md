# Activity Schedule Manager
## ðŸ§  Overview

This project demonstrates best practices in both frontend and backend development:
- **Frontend:** Built with React using pure CSS (no styling libraries) to showcase clean, manual styling.  
  - **State Management:**  
    - [`@tanstack/react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query) for managing server state  
    - `React Context API` for global client state (kept minimal due to scoped needs)

- **Backend:** Developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB  
  - **Design Patterns Applied:**
    - **Singleton Pattern** for MongoDB connection
    - **Strategy Pattern** for handling repeated weekly schedule logic
    - **Repository Pattern** for cleaner DB interaction layer
  - **Other Features:**
    - Built-in rate limiter
    - Basic security enhancements
    - Optimized request/response payloads
    - Centralized error handling

### ðŸ’¡ Key Optimization
Schedules are stored using a `Map` instead of an array to ensure **O(1)** access time for updating and retrieving by dayâ€”improving performance vs. array-based storage (`O(n)`).
